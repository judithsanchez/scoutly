# Final Property Mapping Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

After fixing the ObjectId casting issues, company tracking and ranking updates were working on the backend, but the frontend wasn't properly displaying the updated rankings.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Property Name Mismatch**: The frontend component was accessing the wrong property for the company ranking:

- **Backend Returns**: `trackedCompany.userPreference.rank`
- **Frontend Was Expecting**: `trackedCompany.ranking`

### The Error:

```typescript
// WRONG: This property doesn't exist
const companyRanking = trackedCompany?.ranking ?? 75;

// CORRECT: The actual data structure
const companyRanking = trackedCompany?.userPreference?.rank ?? 75;
```

## Fix Applied

**File**: `src/app/companies/page.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect property access)
const companyRanking = trackedCompany?.ranking ?? 75;

// AFTER (correct property access)
const companyRanking = trackedCompany?.userPreference?.rank ?? 75;
```

## Data Structure Clarification

The `TrackedCompany` interface structure is:

```typescript
interface TrackedCompany {
	_id: string;
	companyID: string;
	company: string;
	careers_url: string;
	logo_url?: string;
	userPreference: {
		rank: number; // ← The ranking value is here
		isTracking: boolean;
		frequency: string;
		lastUpdated: Date;
	};
}
```

## Complete Fix Chain Summary

This was the final piece in a series of fixes:

1. ✅ **Backend API Fix**: Only return actually tracked companies
2. ✅ **Interface Fix**: Added `companyID` field to `TrackedCompany` interface
3. ✅ **ObjectId Casting Fix**: Safe company lookup with proper ObjectId handling
4. ✅ **Property Mapping Fix**: Access correct property path for rankings

## Expected Results

Now the complete user/company tracking flow should work perfectly:

1. ✅ **New Users**: Start with 0 tracked companies
2. ✅ **Track Company**: Can add companies to tracking list
3. ✅ **View Tracking**: Only tracked companies show as tracked
4. ✅ **Edit Rankings**: Can update company rankings and see changes immediately
5. ✅ **Untrack Company**: Can remove companies from tracking

## Technical Notes

- The backend correctly stores and returns rankings in `userPreference.rank`
- The frontend now correctly accesses this nested property
- React Query invalidation ensures UI updates immediately after changes
- All ObjectId casting issues are resolved with safe query building

This completes the full user/company tracking system fix! 🎉
