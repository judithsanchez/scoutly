# Code Cleanup Summary - Phase 1

## Completed Tasks (Tasks 1, 2, 3)

### ✅ Task 1: Removed Compiled JavaScript Files

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Action**: Removed compiled JavaScript files that had TypeScript equivalents:

- `src/services/companyService.js` → TypeScript version exists at `src/services/companyService.ts`
- `src/models/Company.js` → TypeScript version exists at `src/models/Company.ts`
- `src/config/database.js` → TypeScript version exists at `src/config/database.ts`
- `src/scripts/updateCompanyRankings.js` → TypeScript version exists at `src/scripts/updateCompanyRankings.ts`

**Impact**: Eliminates confusion between compiled output and source files, ensures consistency with TypeScript-first approach.

### ✅ Task 2: Removed Deprecated Methods from LogService

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Actions**:

- Removed `createLog()` method marked as `@deprecated Use saveBatchedLogs instead`
- Removed `createLogs()` method marked as `@deprecated Use saveBatchedLogs instead`
- Updated test file to remove tests for deprecated methods

**Impact**: Reduces technical debt, simplifies API surface, eliminates deprecated code paths.

### ✅ Task 3: Coverage Files Management

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Finding**: Coverage directory is already properly ignored via `.gitignore` (entries: `/coverage` and `coverage`)
**Impact**: Coverage artifacts won't be committed to repository, keeping it clean.

## Files Modified:

- `/src/services/logService.ts` - Removed deprecated methods
- `/src/services/__tests__/logService.test.ts` - Removed deprecated method tests
- **Deleted**: 4 compiled JavaScript files

## Next Phase Tasks (Remaining cleanup items):

1. Clean up console.log statements in production code
2. Review and remove outdated documentation
3. Standardize test file organization
4. Review mermaid diagram files for relevance
5. Convert React.FC usage to modern function components
6. Review and consolidate style constants
7. Package.json script cleanup
8. Frontend logger complexity review

## Testing Required:

Please test the application functionality to ensure:

1. All TypeScript compilation still works
2. LogService functionality remains intact
3. No broken imports or missing dependencies
4. Core application features still work

After testing confirms everything works, commit these changes and we'll proceed with the next phase.
