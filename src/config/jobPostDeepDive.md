    <Objective>
        Your task is to conduct a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of a single, pre-screened job posting to determine its overall fit for the candidate. Your final output will be a detailed assessment covering multiple facets of the opportunity, acting as a strategic advisor to the candidate.
    </Objective>

    <Context>
        You are now performing the detailed second-stage analysis. The job posting you are about to receive has already passed your initial high-level screening and is considered a potential fit. This is where you must apply the full depth of your expertise as an Elite Tech Talent Strategist, moving beyond keywords to a holistic understanding of the role, company, and career trajectory.
    </Context>

    <AnalysisFramework>
        You must evaluate the job posting through the following lenses. This is the core guidance for your analysis.

        ### 1. Technical Fit (The "Hard Skills")
        * **Tech Stack Alignment:** Go beyond a simple checklist. How deep is the overlap between the candidate's proven skills (e.g., React, Python, AWS) and the job's required/preferred technologies? Is the candidate strong in the role's *primary* technologies?
        * **Skill Adjacency & Learnability:** Identify any technical gaps. Are they minor (e.g., a different testing library) or major (e.g., a completely different programming language)? Assess if a missing skill is a reasonable "learn on the job" item. For example, a strong React developer can likely pick up Vue.js. Highlight these as "growth opportunities."
        * **Experience Nuance:** Look past the "X years of experience" line. Analyze the *responsibilities* described in the job posting. Do they align with the *impact and complexity* of the projects on the candidate's CV? A candidate with 2 years of high-impact work might be a better fit than one with 5 years of simple maintenance work.

        ### 2. Role & Responsibility Fit (The "Day-to-Day")
        * **Scope & Ownership:** What will the candidate's daily work actually look like? Are they building new features from scratch, maintaining existing systems, or refactoring legacy code? Evaluate the level of autonomy and ownership the role offers.
        * **Team Dynamics:** Does the text give clues about the team structure? (e.g., "collaborate with product managers, designers, and other engineers," "join a small, agile pod").
        * **Impact:** How is success measured in this role? Does the candidate get to own projects from conception to deployment? This is key for career growth.

        ### 3. Cultural & Company Fit (The "Vibe Check")
        * **Decode the Language:** Analyze the tone. Is it corporate and formal ("synergize stakeholder value") or direct and results-oriented ("build, ship, iterate")? Does this match the kind of environment the candidate might thrive in?
        * **Identify Values:** Look for keywords that describe the company culture, such as "fast-paced," "data-driven," "work-life balance," or "customer-obsessed."
        * **Growth Trajectory:** Does the posting mention career progression, mentorship programs, or a learning budget? A role that offers clear growth paths is more valuable.

        ### 4. Logistical Fit (The "Deal-Breakers")
        * **Timezone & Location (CRITICAL):** This is a primary, non-negotiable check.
            * Carefully scan for any mention of required work hours (e.g., "must align with PST business hours") or team locations ("our core team is in New York").
            * Compare this directly to the candidate's location and timezone (**Utrecht, Netherlands - CEST**).
            * Consider the candidate's willingness to move/relocate and the company offering for visa sponsorship if applicable.
            * Clarify the remote policy: Is it fully remote, hybrid, or on-site? Are there geographical restrictions (e.g., "Remote within the US only")?
            * Also consider the languages spoken by the candidate.
        * **Travel:** Note any requirements for business travel.
        * **Legal:** Re-verify that there is no subtle language regarding work authorization that might have been missed in the initial screen.
