Of course. Here is a detailed workflow concept for a Cline tool that helps migrate files from Tailwind CSS to plain CSS within a TypeScript project.

This workflow prioritizes clarity, user control, and the reuse of existing styles.

Workflow: Tailwind CSS to Plain CSS Migration
This workflow outlines the process for a Cline tool to intelligently convert components using Tailwind CSS utility classes into components styled with standard CSS, potentially in CSS Modules or a global stylesheet.

Phase 1: Initialization and Scoping
The first step is to understand the user's intent and gather the necessary information to begin the migration.

Prompt for Target Files: The tool asks the user to specify which files or directories to process. This allows for batch processing.

Tool: ask_followup_question

Example: <ask_followup_question>Which TypeScript files or directories (.ts, .tsx) would you like to migrate from Tailwind CSS?</ask_followup_question>

Identify Global Stylesheet: The tool asks for the location of the primary or root CSS file. This is crucial for checking for existing, reusable CSS variables and classes.

Tool: ask_followup_question

Example: <ask_followup_question>What is the path to your global CSS file? (e.g., src/styles/global.css). I will check this file for reusable variables and classes.</ask_followup_question>

Phase 2: Analysis and Translation (Per File)
For each file in the user-defined batch, the tool will perform a detailed analysis and translation.

Read Component File: The tool reads the content of the target TypeScript component.

Tool: read_file

Example: <read_file><path>src/components/UserProfile.tsx</path></read_file>

Extract Tailwind Classes: The tool parses the file content to find all className attributes and extracts the complete string of Tailwind utility classes.

Tool: search_files with a robust regex or an internal parsing function.

Example Regex: className="([^"]+)"

Input: <div className="p-4 bg-slate-800 text-white rounded-lg md:p-8">

Output: An array of classes: ['p-4', 'bg-slate-800', 'text-white', 'rounded-lg', 'md:p-8']

Analyze Global CSS for Reuse: Before generating new CSS, the tool checks the provided global stylesheet for existing styles that match the intent of the extracted Tailwind classes.

Tool: read_file

Example: <read_file><path>src/styles/global.css</path></read_file>

Internal Logic: The AI analyzes the CSS content. If it finds --spacing-4: 1rem; or --color-primary: #1e293b;, it will prefer using these variables (var(--spacing-4)) over hardcoded values.

Translate Classes to CSS: The AI model categorizes and translates each Tailwind utility into its corresponding CSS rule. This is the core translation step.

Spacing: p-4 -> padding: 1rem;

Colors: bg-slate-800 -> background-color: var(--slate-800); (if variable exists) or background-color: #1e293b;

Typography: text-white -> color: #ffffff;

Borders: rounded-lg -> border-radius: 0.5rem;

Responsive Modifiers: md:p-8 is recognized as a media query. It will be translated into a block like @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }.

Phase 3: Code Generation and User Verification
The tool now generates the new code and presents a clear, actionable plan to the user for approval before making any changes.

Generate New CSS Class: A new, semantic CSS class is proposed. The name can be derived from the component's filename (e.g., UserProfile.tsx -> .user-profile-card).

Assemble the CSS Block: The translated rules are combined into the new class.

CSS

/_ Generated from Tailwind classes in UserProfile.tsx _/
.user-profile-card {
padding: 1rem; /_ from p-4 _/
background-color: #1e293b; /_ from bg-slate-800 _/
color: #ffffff; /_ from text-white _/
border-radius: 0.5rem; /_ from rounded-lg _/
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
.user-profile-card {
padding: 2rem; /_ from md:p-8 _/
}
}
Propose the Changes: The tool presents a final summary to the user for approval. This is a critical step for ensuring user control.

Tool: ask_followup_question

Example:

XML

<ask_followup_question>
I am ready to migrate `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`. Here is the plan:

1.  **In `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`**: I will replace the Tailwind `className` with a new class named `user-profile-card`.

2.  **In `src/styles/global.css`**: I will append the following CSS block:
    `css
    /* CSS for .user-profile-card */
    .user-profile-card {
      padding: 1rem;
      background-color: #1e293b;
      ...
    }
    ...
    `
    Do you want to proceed with these changes?
    </ask_followup_question>
    Phase 4: Execution
    Upon receiving user approval, the tool executes the file modifications.

Update the CSS Stylesheet: The new CSS block is appended to the global stylesheet.

Tool: write_to_file (in append mode, or by reading, modifying, and overwriting).

Example: <write_to_file><path>src/styles/global.css</path><content>[...existing content] [new CSS block]</content></write_to_file>

Update the Component File: The old Tailwind className attribute is replaced with the new, semantic class.

Tool: replace_in_file

Example: <replace_in_file><path>src/components/UserProfile.tsx</path><find>className="p-4 bg-slate-800 text-white rounded-lg md:p-8"</find><replace>className={styles.userProfileCard}</replace></replace_in_file>

(Note: The replacement might be className="user-profile-card" for global CSS or className={styles.userProfileCard} for CSS Modules, which would also require adding an import styles from './UserProfile.module.css';)

Phase 5: Completion
The tool confirms the completion of the task or moves to the next file in the batch.

Final Confirmation:

Tool: attempt_completion

Example: <attempt_completion>Migration for src/components/UserProfile.tsx is complete. Proceeding to the next file.</attempt_completion>
